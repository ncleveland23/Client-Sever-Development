# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing programs, it is important to make sure that the code is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. The program shall be free from security vulnerabilities. The code must be well commented to explain functionality to someone else looking at the code. This helps to make it readable and be understood. The program should also be adaptable in the case that updates need to be made or things need to be changed. You should not have to start from scratch to add something new or remove something. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist approach a problem by looking at what the problem is and developing a way to solve this problem. In this project we were given the requirements from the client and then had to figure out how to develop a solution based on those requirements. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists use technology to solve problems that people may have. They also develop applications to help and assist in doing something to make it easier.
